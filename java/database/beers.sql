Our rich, soft oatmeal stout comes across as almost too much,too sweet and satisfying, so we dialed it back with a hit of Ceylon cinnamon and piles of toasted nuts: black walnuts, pecans, and hazelnuts. Paired together, the whole thing is balanced and soft , with gentle wisps of nutty oatmeal, browned toast, and squishy caramel. Settle in for a spell and plunge these roasty black depths.'

BIPOC-owned breweries are less than 1% of the overall US brewery scene, so who are we to dominate the stage when so many others have so much to say? Brewed with 7 types of malt for a massive, sticky, high-alcohol imperial stout, deep black in color. Flavor/aroma of burnt sugar, dark roast coffee, figs, and a touch of warming alcohol. Proceeds go to Cleveland NAACP to help in their efforts towards building a better world.',
